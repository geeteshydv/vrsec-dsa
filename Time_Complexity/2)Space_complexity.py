Space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input data. It includes both the space required for the input and the space needed for auxiliary variables, data structures, and function call overhead.

Types of Space Complexity
O(1): Constant Space

The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory regardless of the input size. Example: swapping two numbers.
O(n): Linear Space

The memory usage grows linearly with the input size. Example: storing elements in an array or list.
O(n²): Quadratic Space

Memory usage grows quadratically, often seen in algorithms that create a 2D array (e.g., dynamic programming solutions 
for problems like the Knapsack).


Extra Space Complexity -:
Extra space complexity specifically refers to the additional space an algorithm uses beyond the input data. 
It is often a key consideration in algorithms that need to manage large datasets.

O(1): If the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, like a few variables to hold intermediate results.

O(n): If the algorithm requires additional space proportional to the input size, such as copying elements to a new array.

O(n log n): In some sorting algorithms, where additional space is required for merging (e.g., mergesort).

O(n²): Seen in algorithms that create a matrix to store results or states (e.g., dynamic programming for certain problems).

Importance
Understanding both space complexity and extra space complexity is crucial for optimizing algorithms, especially in environments 
with limited memory resources. If you have a specific algorithm in mind, I can help analyze its space complexity!
